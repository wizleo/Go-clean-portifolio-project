                              <p>Our cleaning services platform was founded in 2023 by Nkajja Solomon.
                                 His own frustrating experience in finding reliable and trustworthy cleaning
                                  services led him to create a solution that connects service providers and clients seamlessly<br>
                                  After witnessing the growing demand for cleaning services in Africa and realizing the
                                   lack of a centralized platform, he embarked on a mission to simplify the
                                    process of finding and booking professional cleaners<br>
                                    Our leadership team includes professionals with backgrounds in facility management,
                                     hospitality services, and environmental sustainability, ensuring that we have a 
                                     well-rounded understanding of our clients' needs <br>
                                  </p>
                              <h2>Social Impact</h2>
                              <p>We believe in giving back to the communities we serve. As part of our commitment, we actively
                                 participate in community clean-up campaigns, partnering with local organizations to keep
                                  public spaces clean and safe.<br>
                                  Through our 'Clean Homes, Brighter Futures' initiative, we provide free
